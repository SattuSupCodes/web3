Here is a technical overview of merkling in Ethereum by Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik highlights several reasons for using Patricia Merkle Tries in Ethereum:

1. Efficient data verification (from its merkle properties)
2. More complex light-client queries
3. Can quickly change values and only recompute a portion of the tree (prevents some DDOS attack vectors)
4. There is a limit to the depth of the tree, which prevents other DDOS attack vectors
5.The order of the updates do not matter for the root hash

Ethereum nodes maintain four tries:

A state trie which contains information about Ethereum accounts
A storage trie which is where we can write persistent data from smart contracts
A transactions trie which contains the transactions stored in a block
A receipts trie which contains log/event information from contracts
