Here is a technical overview of merkling in Ethereum by Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik highlights several reasons for using Patricia Merkle Tries in Ethereum:

1. Efficient data verification (from its merkle properties)
2. More complex light-client queries
3. Can quickly change values and only recompute a portion of the tree (prevents some DDOS attack vectors)
4. There is a limit to the depth of the tree, which prevents other DDOS attack vectors
5.The order of the updates do not matter for the root hash

Ethereum nodes maintain four tries:

A state trie which contains information about Ethereum accounts
A storage trie which is where we can write persistent data from smart contracts
A transactions trie which contains the transactions stored in a block
A receipts trie which contains log/event information from contracts

why am I learning about trees and data storage this week?

The reason is that blockchains have a storage problem. They require that nodes in the network store every value recorded in their shared database. For ethereum this means all account balances, 
as well as every persistent variable on a smart contract.
