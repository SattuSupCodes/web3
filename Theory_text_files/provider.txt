Provider
Many Ethereum libraries use the term provider for an object that acts as a 
connection to the Ethereum blockchain. In Ethers.js, a provider helps us reduce 
the code we write. Once you configure the provider you can interact with its methods 
without worrying about the underlying details.

This is commonly referred to as an abstraction in programming. 
The connection details are abstracted away from the programmer. 
Instead we can focus on what we want to do! For instance, 
we can write code to ask the provider for the latest block number 
in the Ethereum blockchain. We don't need to worry whether it's getting 
that block number from infura, etherscan, a local testnet or a remote mainnet node!
