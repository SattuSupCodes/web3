So... How do we communicate with the ethereum computer? The answer is... JSON-RPC!

(refer to the first image in readme.md file for the easy-to-understand diagram)

> Nodes and Clients in ethereum

1. Nodes:  Any instance of Ethereum client software that is connected to other computers also running Ethereum software, forming a network.

2. Client: Implementation of Ethereum that verifies data against the protocol rules and keeps the network secure.

sooo...
JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that uses JSON to encode messages. In other words, JSON-RPC is simply another API standard.

"there is a server out there and I want to call a method on it by executing a remote procedure call"

{
    "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
    "method" : "eth_getBalance",
    "params" : ["0x1u8..."],
    "id" : "0"
}
The above is what a JSON-RPC Request that asks for the account balance of an address looks like.
