for(let i = 0; i >= 0; i++) {
  console.log(i);

How could we create an environment in which code like this would not be able to run infinitely? 

It turns out the simplest way to do this is by adding a monetary cost to each operation. This cost on Ethereum is known as gas.

Gas:-

Gas is a measurement of the cost to each operation that relates to the computational cost that the operation 
incurs on the network. So if you are making every node in the network do some kind of computationally expensive 
task every time they need to verify your transaction, you'll need to pay for significantly 
more than a simple transaction that is sending money from one individual to another.
