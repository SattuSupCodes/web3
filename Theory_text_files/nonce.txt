k so the concept of nonce confuses me a bit
nonce is for number used only once

block_data = "transactions + previous_hash + timestamp"
nonce = 678 (example)

hash = SHA256(block_data + nonce)

output - 0f98... (hash)

NONCE IS NOT A SUBSTRING USED JUST ONCE IN A HASH THIS WAS MY MISCONCEPTION

Its just that hash functions are extremely sensitive â€” one bit changes, entire hash changes.

so nonce is just a random number that miners change repeatedly to alter the block's hash until it meets this condition.
Condition being the difficulty (how many 0s in beginning)
