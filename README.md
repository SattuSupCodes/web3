This repo is a web3 learning journey, refer to these following folders:
1. Theory Folder : Some important theory that I feel is helpful to know, mainly I write in my physical notebook but I'll keep some good ones here for you all as well~

2. Ethereum Bootcamp Codes : we learn about basic cryptogrphy and bitcoin concepts, how secure they are, and how we code for basic ethereum actvities.

3. (to be updated as we proceed further)

#I used git bash to enable ssh and generate key and felt so super buhahahaha
