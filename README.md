# Sattu's WEB3 Journey Begins

I saw how many web3 projects go in hackathons and win prizes, and web2 is soooo old school. Gotta move on to some transactional quests!


# What This Repo Contains
This repo is a web3 learning journey, refer to these following folders:
1. Theory Folder : Some important theory that I feel is helpful to know, mainly I write in my physical notebook but I'll keep some good ones here for you all as well~

2. Ethereum Bootcamp Codes : we learn about basic cryptogrphy and bitcoin concepts, how secure they are, and how we code for basic ethereum actvities.

3. (to be updated as we proceed further)

#I used git bash to enable ssh and generate key and felt so super buhahahaha
# Diagrams To Understand JSON-RPC
Json RPC is something VERY IMPORTANT in ethereum blockchain so, I'm giving that a special spot in my very visible Readme file.
1. What we build with help of JSON-RPC

3. You can try this jsonRpc request on your command line (windows)

`curl -X POST --data “{\“jsonrpc\”:\”2.0\”,\”method\”:\”eth_blockNumber\”,\”params\”:[],\”id\”:83}” https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/gZgOOh1X3cpVWXeVR9EL51zC1vpbggIF`

output:

# Things I Found Difficult
1. Merkle tree and patricia tree difficult shi to code, I keep getting lost.
